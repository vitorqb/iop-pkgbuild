* Improved OP PkgBuild

Since https://github.com/vitorqb/iop/ is private, before =makepkg=, you need to:
1. Download the appropriate release from the source in ur browser
   https://github.com/vitorqb/iop/archive/refs/tags/x.y.z.tar.gz
2. Copy the file here (named iop-$version.tar.gz)
3. Make sure go knows how to fetch packages:
   : GIT_SSH="ssh-personal" GOPRIVATE="github.com/vitorqb/*" makepkg -si

Note we assume something like this is in ur PATH:

file:ssh-personal
#+begin_src sh
#!/bin/bash
ssh -i $PERSONAL_KEY "$@"
#+end_src
